When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to work from another pc and, also, when I want my updates to be easily viewed publicly.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Pulling changes manually mostly helps know that the code in the remote repository actually works, even though the last updates in the local repository sometimes end up with a non-working code.
